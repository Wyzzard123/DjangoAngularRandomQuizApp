# Random Quiz Generator (Django + Angular Version)

This is a new version of the [Random Quiz Generator](https://github.com/Wyzzard123/quiz-app) using Django as the backend and Angular as the front end.

It serves mostly as an experiment for me to create a full stack single page application using Angular while leveraging on my prior knowledge of Django.
